# PowerMate-Sublime-Plugin
## Summary
I started using Griffin Powermate with Sublime to navigate thru all tabs in my development workflow. Found that is annoying when you navigate too quickly and circle back on the other side of the screen, I wanted to be able to twist the PowerMate knob quickly without having to worry about it going all the way to the other side of the screen. 

So I went and built this, as my first attempt to Python. Now I can just map PowerMate's function to what the keybindings are and it will stop at either side of the Tab bar. 

That's all there is.
