# PowerMate-Sublime-Plugin
## Summary
A few weeks ago, I started using **Griffin Powermate** with **Sublime Text 3** and Google Chrome to navigate thru all Tabs in my *development workflow*. 

After a few days I found that **Google Chrome** allows me to turn the know quickly and it will stop by the moment I reach the last tab. Which makes it easy to just navigate quickly, knowing that you'll havigate in the direction you're scrolling.

In the case of **Sublime**, it has this annoying tendency to jump to the first tab if you scroll past the last one, the very opposite of what I intended, resulting in you having to think about it and be careful about not jumping back to the beginning.

So I went and built this project as my first attempt to write **Python**.

* Jump to Next Tab in the current Group
* Jump to Previous Tab in the current Group
* Jump to First Tab in the current Group
* Jump to Last Tab in the current Group

This commands can easily be mapped to PowerMate's interactions using the **PowerMate Config** app.
